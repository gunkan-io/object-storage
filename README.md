## License

Distributed under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for more information.

I strongly believe in Open Source for many reasons:
* For software quality purposes because a software with open sources is the best
  way to have its bugs identified and fixed as soon as possible.
* For a greater adoption, we chose a deliberately liberal license so that
  there cannot be any legal concern.
* Because I do not expect to make any money with this, ever.
